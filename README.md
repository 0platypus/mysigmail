## Purpose

Creating an email signature is not a trivial task, even for people who have knowledge of HTML and CSS. And what about ordinary users.

There are many solutions on the Internet, and most of them are paid. There are free, but all of them are closed source. I wanted to make a free application with a user-friendly interface and open source code.

So let's make creating email signatures easier!

## Features

- Upload image - upload image by url or embed via base64
- Custom fields - add custom fields
- Social icons - add social icons
- Options - customize signature
- Addons - additional options (yet only one)
- Templates - templates for signature (yet only one)
- Projects - save, download or import projects
- Signature preview - preview signature

## Roadmap

- Create more templates (PR Welcome)
- Create more addons (PR Welcome)

## Development

```bash
npm i
npm run serve
```
